# RL Agent: Connect Four

This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to play the classic Connect Four game. The agent is trained using algorithms like Monte Carlo and SARSA to learn optimal strategies for this strategic board game.

---

## Overview

Connect Four is a two-player game where the goal is to align four of your discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on a 6x7 grid. This project showcases how RL techniques can be used to develop a competitive agent for this game.

---

## Features

- Implementation of **Monte Carlo** and **SARSA** algorithms.
- Step-by-step demonstration of the training process and agent performance.
- Visualization of rewards and policy improvements.
- Modular and reusable Python codebase for RL projects.
